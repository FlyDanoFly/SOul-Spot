There are three kinds of paints that glow:
- Flourescent paint
	- glows only under the illumination of a black light
	- we don't want this for the SOuL Spot
- [[Phosphorescent paint]]
	- glows after being "charged"
	- lights in the lower spectrum 200-500nm are best (might depend on the kind of material used?)
	- this is the kind we want in the SOuL Spot
- Radioluminescent
	- glows on its own accord via radioactive decay
	- we don't want this for the SOuL Spot
