Phosphorescent paint comes from two main sources
- zinc sulfide
- strontium aluminate

- They generally come as powders
	- In a variety of colors and powder sizes
	- Smaller particles make a smoother paint that doesn't glow as bright
- They need to be mixed with something to be turned into paint
- It is best to use them within the hour of mixing them
- What to mix them with?
	- If you want the paint to be invisible to light, use a clear like an Acrylic Gel
	- If you want to see the paint in the light, chose an acrylic or tempera paint in a color you like
	- Make sure the paint medium works with the powder
		- If you're planning on using a **water-based medium**, the nyou will need **"coated glow powder"** also known as **"coated phosphorescent pigment"**
		- For **solvent or oil-based mediums**, you can use **standard or uncollated glow power**
- Seems to be a 1:5 powder to substrate ratio
	- I'm not sure on the coverage, need to experiment

## Stronium Aluminate
- Tends to be better that Zinc Sulfide, either brighter and/or lasting longer
- Study by the FAA determined that SA was suitable for aviation exit lighting whereas ZS was not [source](https://www.faa.gov/data_research/research/med_humanfacs/oamtechreports/1990s/media/9802.pdf)
- Excitation wavelengths tend to be between 200 to 450nm, emission 420 to 520nm 
	- Green formulation wavelength is 520nm, highest brightness
	- Aqua / blue-green formulation is 505nm, lasts longest
	- Blue formulations is 490nm

## Zinc Sulfide
- Looks to be more ubiquitous, not sure about the price
- Unclear what the excitation and emission spectrums are
-
